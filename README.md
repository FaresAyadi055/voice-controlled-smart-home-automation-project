smart home automation project:

This voice controlled smart home automation project creates a voice-controlled system using a Raspberry Pi 4 to manage devices and environmental sensors within a mini home setup. A mobile app built with Thunkable serves as the user interface, enabling control both locally and remotely. The system's communication is centralized and managed by a server, which coordinates requests and data exchange between the mobile app and the Raspberry Pi.
